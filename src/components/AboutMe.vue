    <p class="lead text-center">
      Hi! I'm Rom, a 3rd year college student currently working at Ebit Global as a web developer.
    </p>
    <div class="about-me">
      <p>
        I'm passionate about building web applications and actively work with technologies like Vue.js,
        React, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express. I enjoy learning by doing â€” whether it's creating
        new features, experimenting with UI libraries, or exploring full-stack workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also diving deep into Linux, particularly Arch Linux with Hyprland, to fine-tune my development
        environment and better understand how everything fits together under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy going to the gym and jogging to keep a healthy balance between tech and
        lifestyle. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope this guide helps you on your journey!

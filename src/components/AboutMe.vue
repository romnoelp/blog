  <h2 class="mb-3 text-center">About Me</h2>
  <p class="lead text-center">
    Hi! I'm Rom, a 3rd year student and aspiring full web developer based in the Philippines.
  </p>
  <div class="about-me">
    <p>
      I’m currently diving deep into the world of Linux, specifically Arch Linux and Hyprland, to
      sharpen my skills and gain more control over my development environment. I enjoy learning by
      building, tweaking, and documenting my journey — just like this guide you're reading now!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also experiment with tools like Supabase, Laravel, and Docker, aiming to eventually become a
      well-rounded developer. When I’m not coding, I hit the gym or go jogging to keep both my mind
      and body sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thanks for stopping by, and I hope this guide helps you get started with your own Arch +
      Hyprland setup!
